                Welcome! Today, we shall be building a working game in
                React/Next.js.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this exercise, you will be creating a working game that
                allows players to guess whether the next card in the deck is red
                or black.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal of this task is to assess your attention to detail,
                ability to create interactive UI elements, basic understanding
                of endpoints, and your thought process.
              </p>
